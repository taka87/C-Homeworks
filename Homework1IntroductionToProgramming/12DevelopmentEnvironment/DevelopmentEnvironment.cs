//        Eclipse
//This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio.
//The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that
//are possible to use extend past the.Net Framework.Besides being the number on way to
//develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages
//such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.

//Netbeans
//The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it
// compiles code which is a bonus. When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server
//called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment.
//This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere (which is a whole
//different ball game).

//kate
//Kate is exactly how the website describes it, a text editor.Not to be looked down upon
//as it does a lot more than a regular text edit can do and that is what makes this an
//indispensable product.
//This is probably one of the best features for kate. [Mike Szczys] explains that there 
//is a small column to the left of the code.Any line that is an opening bracket that
//column will have an arrow next to it. If you click the arrow it will fold all of the
//code between the opening and closing brackets. Very useful for large source packages.

//gedit
//Gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system
//is setup.Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking
//major projects. This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.
//gedit offers the ability to highlight your code and figure out where the bugs are by
//giving you a fresh perspective. This can also be used for web development, to help
//developers see where the start of nodes are and where to submit the end nodes, doing
//this could cut down drastically on XHTML  issues.

//Code::Blocks
//Unlike the other products seen thus far, Code::Blocks, which is built on the wxWidgets
//framework, is exceptionally lightweight in size, yet still quite functional and
//feature-rich IDE. You can load up a number of under-the-hood compiler engines, ranging
//from GCC and LLVM, to Digital Mars and Open Watcom. Code::Blocks also takes advantage of
//multi-core compiling, allowing you to get the job done faster. Code::Blocks is distributed
//under the GPL v3.0 license which means it can be used freely by anyone.

//Aptana Studio 3

//If web and scripting languages are more of your style, Aptana is well suited for the task. 
//PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR.Even the
//studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse if you prefer the way Aptana handles
//your work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE. Aptana Studio 3 is free
//and available solely under the GNU General Public License.
